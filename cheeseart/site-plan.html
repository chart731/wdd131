			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To showcase different works of art from a family member, and give them
                the opportunity to share how they got where they are at today, and an 
                opportunity to share their art with many different people.
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>General art community, teenagers and young adults that
                are looking for commissioned works of art.
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I am going to use the parent page as a gallery/information section, so I am going
                to use a modal/viewer window for the pictures on that page as a dynamic element.
                For the second page, it will be more of a shop/selection page, where users can look
                at the artworks from the previous page and choose which ones they would like to buy.
                There will be working buttons and inputs that will allow the user to choose how many
                they would like to buy of each item, and it will then add up the total amount that the
                user owes.
            </p>

			<h3>Website Logo</h3>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

                <img class="portrait" src="portrait-sm.jpg" alt="Drawing of Eva">
                <img class="octopus" src="octopus-sm.jpg" alt="Clay octopus">
                <p>Paragraph 1 for home page: Hi, I'm Eva! I create art under the alias Cheese. I'm a budding artist that experiments in all different art mediums.
                    I have been experimenting and creating for around 10 years, trying different styles to see what fits for me. It's been a fun process so far, and 
                    is super rewarding! The creative process is something that helps me relax, and I want others to be able to find that for themselves.
                </p><br>
                <p>Paragraph 2 for home page: If you are interested in art, but don't what your style is yet, I encourage you to just get creating! It took me years
                    to figure out what my style was. I hope that by sharing my art, I can help inspire others to pick up a pen, brush, or block of clay, and just try
                    your hand at it. You'll never know what you're missing out on if you don't try it out first!
